## My process

### Built with

- React
  - useState
  - useReducer
  - context
- Tailwind CSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me to learn and practice manipulating states in React. Although, I used `useReducer` in [the last project](https://github.com/kens-visuals/calculator-app), I left like I need more practice with it. So, to-do app was a perfect opportunity to play with `useReducer` a bit more. I also used `context` for the first time, `createContext` and `useContext` hooks were pretty easy to use. I felt kind of lost in the beginning, but then got back on the track with them. Thanks to `TailwindCSS` implementing dark mode was really easy. And with the help of custom context that I made to toggle the theme, everything felt way easier than if I tried to do it with `pure CSS` or `styled-components`. So I can surely say that `TailwindCSS` is becoming one of my favorite, if not the most favorite, tool in terms of styling technologies.

### Useful resources

- [How to Use React useReducer Hook Like a Pro](https://devtrium.com/posts/how-to-use-react-usereducer-hook) - Sometimes there are some articles that are better than the official documentation, so this is one of them.
